# Chat-Bot-Python-OpenAI-Chat-Bot-using-Python-and-OpenAI
This repository contains a simple Python command-line chatbot that uses the DeepSeek R1-Chimera model through the OpenRouter API. Although the openai Python library is imported, the script does not connect to OpenAI. Instead, it uses a custom base_url to communicate directly with OpenRouter, which supports the same API format.
